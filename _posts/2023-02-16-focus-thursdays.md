Focus day is an alternative to the more common _No meetings day_. We put emphasis in
the meaning of focus, not the meeting schedule.

## Focus Day

Sometimes we need to focus in some work that involves entering
[the flow or the zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Some other
times we need to look things from a distance in order to plan or cooperate with another
person in order to unblock something.

What they have in common is the lack of external interruptions not related with the
task at issue.

## Meetings or no meetings

In general, any meeting that could be scheduled another day, should not happen
during Focus Day. Planning, status and brainstorming meetings are examples for
this category.

In particular, meetings to unblock an issue or to pair in order to solve a task
that one is focusing on are encouraged.

## Calendar event

We can create a calendar event that will be spawned along all Thursdays, so
that will be a visible indicator for planned meetings that it is the day
were those should not happen.

## But I need to

Focus Days are not mandatory and rigid, the intent is to create a safe structure
for people that need to focus, and that will not be reprimanded in any way for
rejecting to have a meeting during this day. If for some reason we do not need to
focus one Thursday, we might want to select that specific day in the calendar and
mark our attendance as nope.
