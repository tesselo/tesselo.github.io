After 7 years of hard work, our passion project, our beloved venture, our partnership has come to an end.
Like countless other startups, Tesselo has failed and died. Now that we have reached the end,
we turn remembering Tesselo into a celebration. We will hold memories of our dear venture joyfully.

The first reason to celebrate the end of Tesselo is the successfuly continuation of the careers of
everyone that was involved in the project. We can proudly say that nobody regrets their participation,
on the contrary. We have seen the growth of everyone while Tesselo was alive, and can witness
the impact it has on the humans - the Tesseras - that have worked with us over time.

We know that celebrating failure is in fashion and spinned the wrong way can be harmful.
By no means we wish for anyone to fail, because not every failure must be seen as an oportunity.
But it so happens that Tesselo's failure does not feel like a defeat. We knew when to stop
and acted decisefully to make a graceful landing. We helped everyone to find new challenges,
and have seen that happen quickly. We did not go bankrupt.

So now that Tesselo is dead, what remains? We have decided do die with honour by cutting
our guts open and spreading them for everyone to see. This page is where you can find the remains,
which include as much as we have time and legal rights to share.

Enjoy weeding through the remains, we hope there is something of use for you in here!
